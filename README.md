codingame challenge
===================

http://www.codingame.com/ranking-multiplayer/platinum-rift

I've begun this challenge 5 days before the end, so I was quite in a hurry,
beeing kwown that it lasted for 20 days.

The challenge permits only one file, so don't expect to find clean headers in here.

Main goal was to challenge home-made IAs on a Risk-like game.
Games could involve 2 up to 4 players, in a free-for-all mode.

Basic rules :
each turn, you deploy pods (units) and move existant pods.

During first turn, you received informations about the board, number of players, starting money(platinum) and so on

Each turn, you receive update about board.
Each turn, game expects you to provide 2 outputs.
 - one giving informations about pods you want to move.
 - one about pods you want to create.

It was a fun challenge.
Being said that codingame provide challenge like that every 2 or 3 months,
feel free to try some !

There is plenty of available langage :
 from classic C++, Java, C#, Pyhton to more specific langage like Clojure, Scala Go or even BASH !
